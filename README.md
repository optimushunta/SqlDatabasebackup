# SqlDatabasebackup
This repository houses a PowerShell script designed to automate the backup process for the SQL database. Regular backups are crucial for data integrity and disaster recovery. Feel free to explore, contribute, and ensure your database is always backed up for peace of mind.
You can add a touch to the script by creating a task scheduler for it to run daily, weekly or monthly.

Check out my video on task scheduler:
